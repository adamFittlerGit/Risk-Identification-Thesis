# Unintentional Weed Dispersal by Humans and Livestock

## Mechanical Seed Transportation Mechanisms

### Human-Assisted Spread
- Clothing and footwear as seed carriers
  - Microscopic seeds caught in fabric threads
  - Treads of boots collecting seed pods
- Vehicle and machinery transmission
  - Mud and soil containing dormant seeds
  - Undercarriage and tire treads as transport vectors
- Construction and land development activities
  - Soil movement between sites
  - Heavy equipment as long-distance seed movers

### Livestock Dispersal Mechanisms
- Cattle as mobile seed distribution systems
  - Seeds caught in fur and hide
  - Seed pods lodged in hooves
  - Digestive system as potential seed carrier
- Grazing pattern influences
  - Movement between pastures
  - Trampling of ground creating ideal germination conditions
  - Nutrient-rich droppings supporting seed germination

## Transmission Pathways
1. **Direct Physical Attachment**
   - Seeds hooking onto hair/fur
   - Sticky seed pods clinging to surfaces
   - Microscopic seeds embedded in soil particles

2. **Indirect Transportation**
   - Mud and soil residue on vehicles
   - Animal waste containing viable seeds
   - Movement through agricultural and natural landscapes

## Mitigation Strategies
- Thorough cleaning of equipment
- Washing vehicles and machinery
- Implementing biosecurity protocols
- Using seed-catching mats and cleaning stations
- Restricting livestock movement between infested and clean areas
